            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p> Everyday people happen upon homeless, abandoned or stray animals that need help. Some might attempt to get support from local rescues, only to find that the rescue is full and has little or no resources to help. When this happens, the individual is often faced with the decision as to whether they take it upon themselves to help the animal or let the animal be and hope that the next person that comes along might help.  Those with limited financial resources fear that they won’t be able to afford the cost of helping the animal. Many attempt to do so anyway, often at the expense of their own well-being. </p>

               <h5>Problem</h5>
               <p>When stray or abandoned animals are rescued, at the minimum they will need a basic health exam, flea/worm medication, and vaccines. Many will also need to be spayed or neutered. An injured or sick animal will need even more. Costs can amount to hundreds, or even thousands of dollars, potentially creating hardships for well-meaning individuals. This can result in the animal not getting the necessary care that is needed or even deter individuals who desire to rescue. </p>

               <h5>Solution</h5>
               <p>RescueFund is a mobile application that assists rescuers in obtaining donations for the veterinary care of a recently rescued animal. Contributions from donors will only be accessible to veterinary clinics, ensuring that 100% of the donations are going directly to the costs of the veterinary procedures needed by the rescued animal.  Because choosing to rescue an animal is a huge responsibility, the completed application will also provide resources such as a directory of local low-cost veterinary clinics, information on how to safely find a rescued animal a “forever home”, and further education regarding animal rescue.  </p>

               <p> I created a survey to learn more about my potential users
                  and to determine if there would be a need for a funding application that
                  focuses solely on the veterinary care of rescued animals.

               <br>

               <ul>
                  <li> 77% of all respondents reported that they have rescued an animal. </li>
                  <li> 68% of rescuer respondents, reported that the cost of needed
                     veterinary care was a concern when rescuing an animal.
                  </li>
                  <li> 88% of the rescuer respondents, reported that they are not
                     affiliated with an official animal rescue group or organization.

            <h5> Competitive Analysis</h5>
            <p> To gain a deeper understanding of current fundraising platforms
               I analyzed three potential competitors: <br> <span class ="comp">GoFundMe, Fundrazr, and Waggle.

          <p> Based on my analysis I determined that my application would need the following in order to stand out: </p>
            <ul>
               <li> A focus on raising funds for rescued animals veterinary care<br><br>
                  <span class ="ci"> Of my competitors, Waggle was the only fundraising site that was focused solely on animal health care. Their platform was geared more towards pets and pet owners needing funds for various medical procedures,
                  rather than for rescuers and rescued animals.</span>

                  <span class ="ci"> Rescuing an animal is a time-consuming tasks and animal
                  rescuers are often on the go. Being able to easily and quickly set up a rescue
                  fundraiser via smartphone and share it immediately with networks is
                  of utmost importance.</span>

               user stories</a> for new and returning rescuers and donors. Based on the high priority stories, I sketched user
               flows for onboarding, signing in, creating a rescue fundraiser and making a donation. After I completed my sketched I used Figma to create digital versions.

               <p> Because animal rescuers are often on the go, it made sense to first
                  design for a native IOS application. Once the animal is safe, seeking veterinary care is often
                  the first step a rescuer needs to take. My goal was to create an efficient interface that
                  would allow rescuers to start a campaign and get the word out to their networks as quickly as
                  possible, without sacrificing essential details. With this in mind, I first sketched my wireframes. After completing my sketches, I used Figma to create  <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ISqFCCrcUiEd2FtbjhTA4KBDXzlF_aMv?usp=sharing" target="_blank">digital versons of my wireframes </a>.

               <h5> Branding & Identity</h5>
               <p> I decided it would be best to give the application a straightforward name that didn’t cause confusion or
                  distract the potential user from the serious task at hand. With that goal, RescueFund was born.
                  Montserrat was used for the typeface logo.
               </p>
               <img src="images/rescuefund-logo.svg" class="rf-logo" alt="RescueFund Logo">
               <p>Because I had decided to design the application for IOS,
                  I utilized the San Francisco system typeface to achieve clarity and consistency.
                  I used font weight, size, and color to establish hierarchy through the design.
               </p>
               <img src="images/rf-type.png" class="typeface" alt="RescueFund Typography">
               <p>Shades of teal were used to help certain elements stand out against the predominately
                  white background. I chose it not only for its vibrancy but also because it combines the
                  stability, trust and calming quality of blue with the healing properties of green.
                  It is also a color that implies independence, which might resonate with those inclined to step up as DIY animal rescuers.

               I then conducted user tests. I had the participant perform a series of tasks including
               signing up for an account, creating a rescue alert, donating to a rescued animal, accessing their account settings and logging out.
               I also asked for user feedback on the overall design, look and feel of the application.
               Along, with in-person user testing, I also used Maze to conduct online testing and gain additional feedback. While users were able to easily
               complete all assigned tasks, I did receive some valubale feedback regarding a few visual elements of my screens. </p>

               <h5>Conclusion</h5>
               <p> RescueFund is a “passion project” for me and one that I would like to continue to develop.
                  Because I had so many ideas, determining which features to include in the prototype proved to be
                  a challenge. Staying true to the MVP and creating screens for my high priority user stories allowed me to
                  stay focused on designing an initial prototype, even though I had very limited resources and time.<br><br>

                 Due to my own experiences rescuing animals, I went into this project with many assumptions.
                  Creating surveys and conducting user research validated many of them, however, I would need to
                  take a much deeper dive into user research and testing should I decide to make RescueFund a reality.
                  The additional research would not only be needed from the rescuer/donor side, but also from
                  the perspective of the veterinary clinics and their staff. The application will only be as beneficial
                  to the animals as it is to all of the users.
