                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p class="description"> Everyday people happen upon homeless, abandoned or stray animals that need help. Some might attempt to get support from local rescues, only to find that the rescue is full and has little or no resources to help. When this happens, the individual is often faced with the decision as to whether they take it upon themselves to help the animal or let the animal be and hope that the next person that comes along might help.  Those with limited financial resources fear that they won’t be able to afford the cost of helping the animal. Many attempt to do so anyway, often at the expense of their own well-being. </p>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
            <p class="description">When stray or abandoned animals are rescued, at minimum they will need a basic health exam, flea/worm medication, and vaccines. Many will also need to be spayed or neutered. An injured or sick animal will need even more. Costs can amount to hundreds, or even thousands of dollars, potentially creating hardships for well-meaning individuals. This can result in the animal not getting the necessary care that is needed, or even deter individuals who desire to rescue.. </p>
        </div>
          <div class="solution">
            <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
            <p class="description">RescueFund is a mobile application that assists rescuers in obtaining donations for the veterinary care of a recently rescued animal. Contributions from donors will only be accessible to veterinary clinics, ensuring that 100% of the donations are going directly to the costs of the veterinary procedures needed by the rescued animal.  Because choosing to rescue an animal is a huge responsibility, the completed application will also provide resources such as a directory of local low-cost veterinary clinics, information on how to safely find a rescued animal a “forever home”, and further education regarding animal rescue.  </p>

          <h3> COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p class="description"> To gain a deeper understanding of current fundraising platforms I analyzed three potential competitors: GoFundMe, Fundrazr and Waggle.<br><br>
               Based on my analysis I determined that my application would need the following in order to stand out: </p>
             </div>

            <div class="features">
                <ul>
                    <li> A focus on raising funds for rescued animals veterinary care</li>
<p class="description"> Of my competitors, Waggle was the only fundraising site that was focused solely on animal health care. Their platform was geared more towards pets and pet owners needing funds for various medical procedures, rather than for rescuers and rescued animals.
 </p>
                    <li>A strong mobile application</li>
                    <p class="description">
Rescuing an animal is a time consuming tasks and animal rescuers are often on the go. Being able to easily and quickly set up a rescue fundraiser via smartphone and share it immediately with networks is of utmost importance.
</p>


                    <li>Donations to only be accessible by the performing veterinary clinic.  </li>
                      <p class="description"> This ensures that the donor’s money is going only towards the veterinary care for a rescued animal and gives the donor confidence when donating.

            <p class="description"> I created a survey in order to discover user’s interest in features potentially
                offered by a new cloud storage service. Upon survey analysis I found that free storage space, the
                ability to upload files from a computer or mobile device, and sharing files or folders were the
                features of a cloud service that users considered to be of utmost importance.
                <br><br> I also found that 80% of users use a cloud service for personal endeavors.</p>

            <h2>BRANDING & IDENTITY</h2>
            <p class="description"> In order to brainstorm the name and concept for my new cloud service, I went
                for a jog. By the time I finished, I determined that I would base the branding of my cloud service
                on the chakra system and simply name it “chakra”.
                My primary reason for basing my cloud’s brand and concept on the chakra system was the
                visualization of the cloud service as an “energy center” for creativity. I also liked the idea of
                finding connections and incorporating the visual and conceptual elements of the chakra system into
                a cloud service.

            <p class="description"> Striving for simplicity, I decided to go with a combination of my first idea

                the enso influenced sketch. <br> <br>With this in mind, I used Ilustrator to create my digital

            <p class="description"> The spiral in the logo is symbolic of the chakra energy center. It is also a
                shape the occurs frequently in nature, thus is very familiar, appealing and comforting. I used

                Along with in-person testing, I also exported my prototype to Maze Design order to receive
                additional remote feedback. In both cases all tasks were completed successfully with the exception
                of renaming the file. Because of this I decided to change my design to give the user the option of
                clicking on the actual filename in order to rename the file. </p>

            <h2>IN CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p class="description"> This project was a major learning experience for me. While I believe that I was
                successful in creating an intuitive interface with a slightly different aesthetic than most known
                cloud services, there are some things that I would do differently if I had more time. <br><br>

                I think it would have been beneficial for me to conduct additional research after deciding on the
                concept for my cloud service. Because I decided to target a somewhat niche audience, it would have
                been nice to survey and perform additional user testing on individuals specifically involved in
                creative or healing arts. I believe additional feedback from them would have been invaluable to the
                design of chakra.<br><br>

                During the design process, I also had ideas about incorporating some kind of weekly or daily short
                creative activity, exclusive to chakra, that would encourage members to be connect and share their
                creations. This, of course is not a function of a typical cloud service, however if chakra was ever
                to be developed beyond a student project, this is a concept that I would further consider and
                research. </p>
