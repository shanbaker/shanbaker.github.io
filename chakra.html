            <p class="description"> In order to better understand the market, I conducted a SWOT analysis of
                three
                major competitors. </p>

            <p class="description"> Based on my SWOT analysis, I determined that a new competitor
                would need, at minimum, the following features: </p>
            <p class="description"> Based on my SWOT analysis, I determined that a new competitor
                would need, at minimum, the following features: </p>

            <div class="features">
                <ul>
                    <li>A robust free plan</li>
                    <li>A modern and intuitive interface</li>
                    <li>The ability to upload and share files, as well as collaborate </li>
                    <li>The option to create notes and documents within the app.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="description"> I also noticed that all of the companies I researched evoked a very
                business-like or corporate mood via their websites. Upon making this observation, I did
                additional
                research which consisted of viewing other cloud server’s websites. I found most of them to be
                similar.<br><br>

                Taking this into consideration, I decided that an additional way for a new cloud service to
                enter a
                highly saturated market would be to focus on a niche audience that would appreciate an
                interface
                that nurtures the idea of using a cloud service for creative and personal endeavors, rather
                than
                for business matters. </p>

                offered by a new cloud storage service. Upon survey analysis I found that free storage space, the
                ability to upload files from a computer or mobile device, and sharing files or folders were the
                features of a cloud service that users considered to be of utmost importance.
                <br><br> I also found that 80% of users use a cloud service for personal endeavors.</p>

            <p class="description"> In order to brainstorm the name and concept for my new cloud service, I went
                for a jog. By the time I finished, I determined that I would base the branding of my cloud service
                on the chakra system and simply name it “chakra”.
                My primary reason for basing my cloud’s brand and concept on the chakra system was the
                visualization of the cloud service as an “energy center” for creativity. I also liked the idea of
                finding connections and incorporating the visual and conceptual elements of the chakra system into
                a cloud service.

                Along with in-person testing, I also exported my prototype to Maze Design order to receive
                additional remote feedback. In both cases all tasks were completed successfully with the exception
                of renaming the file. Because of this I decided to change my design to give the user the option of

            <h2>IN CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p class="description"> This project was a major learning experience for me. While I believe that I was
                successful in creating an intuitive interface with a slightly different aesthetic than most known
                cloud services, there are some things that I would do differently if I had more time. <br><br>

                I think it would have been beneficial for me to conduct additional research after deciding on the
                concept for my cloud service. Because I decided to target a somewhat niche audience, it would have
                been nice to survey and perform additional user testing on individuals specifically involved in
                creative or healing arts. I believe additional feedback from them would have been invaluable to the
                design of chakra.<br><br>

                During the design process, I also had ideas about incorporating some kind of weekly or daily short
                creative activity, exclusive to chakra, that would encourage members to be connect and share their
                creations. This, of course is not a function of a typical cloud service, however if chakra was ever
                to be developed beyond a student project, this is a concept that I would further consider and
                research. </p>
