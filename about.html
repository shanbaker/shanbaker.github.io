           <h2>Hi, I'm <span class="intro">Shan</span> - <br><br> a UX Designer based in
              in Northern NJ.
           </h2>
           <br>
           <p>As a life-long creative, with over fifteen years in the professional music industry, I've done many things, such as composed original music for my 19-member progressive jazz orchestra, played saxophone in various bands and taught private music lessons to hundreds of students of various ages and backgrounds.</p>
           <p> Along with music I've always had a fascination with design and technology. As I young child I was constantly drawing and writing to make sense of the world around me. As a teen I worked summers in my uncle's construction office and would often study and obsess over house plans that the architects would send. I also had a friend who's dad had a computer business. Often, after school I would often find myself in a garage helping them build PCs. More recently I've found myself creating websites for my various music projects and trying to decipher code from websites that I found interesting, useful or visually pleasing. </p>
           <p> My passion for UX Design stems from my fascination with human psychology, communication, emotions, and energy. One aspect that I love about being a designer and a composer is the opportunity to emerge people into the flow of an experience. I enjoy the process and challenge of bridging the abstract connections between one’s internal and external world and always strive to bring this element to anything that I create. </p>
           <p>I am also very passionate about human rights, animal rights and social justice. With the strong belief that design and technology can be leveraged to benefit those that are vulnerable or marginalized, I am constantly brainstorming ideas for apps and platforms that have the potential to better society. </p>
